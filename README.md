# Calculator

Caclulator is a program that takes in an expresssion and calcualtes the expression into a result in number format.

Currently allowed inputs:
  - Addition: +
  - Subtraction: -
  - Multiplication: *
  - Division: /
  - Factorials: ! (After the number)
  - Exponents:  ^
  - Parentheses: ( )

# How to run

To run, simply open up intellij or another Java IDE and either run the tests in ComputerTests for predefined equations or alternaitvely run the main method in the main class and provide a custom expression for the calculator to calculate. After running, type in the expression and hit enter. The calculator will print back the answer.

Please note that the program uses validation so only valid input is allowed.

# Future possible improvements
  - Use cache for operators and not just the parentheses. Don't use for loops here.
  - Use as a library in another program.
  - Accept decimal place for output as a parameter in the main calculate method.
