# Calculator

Caclulator is a program that takes in an expresssion and calcualtes the expression into a result in number format.

Currently allowed inputs:
  - Addition: +
  - Subtraction: -
  - Multiplication: *
  - Division: /
  - Factorials: ! (After the number)
  - Exponents:  ^
  - Parentheses: ( )

To run, simply open up intellij or another Java IDE and either run the tests in ComputerTests for predefined equations or alternaitvely run the main method in the main class and provide a custom expression for the calculator to calculate. After running, type in the expression and hit enter. The calculator will print back the answer.

Future possible work for improvements:
  - Use cache for operators and not just the parentheses. Don't use for loops here.
